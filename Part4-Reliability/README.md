# Reliability

In this part, we'll guide you through the process of testing and configuring two key code-level design patterns to add redundancy throughout critical flows at different workload layers: the retry and the circuit-breaker. The retry pattern involves making repeated attempts to execute a task until it succeeds, while the circuit-breaker pattern prevents a system from executing a task that's likely to fail, to avoid further system degradation.

Building upon the foundations set in Part 0, where we introduced basic retry and circuit-breaker mechanisms using simple examples, this section dives deeper into their practical applications within larger, more complex systems. Here, we demonstrate how these patterns can be effectively scaled to handle higher loads and more critical business operations, enhancing the overall reliability of your application.

## Retry and Circuit Break Pattern

In the reference example, we built an app configuration setting, `CONTOSO_RETRY_DEMO`, that lets you simulate and test a transient failure when making a web request to GitHub. When set to 1, this setting simulates a failure for every web request to GitHub, triggering both the retry and circuit-breaker mechanisms. A value of 2 generates a 503 error for every other request. Other values will not trigger these behaviors.

The reference implementation uses the `Spring Boot Actuator` to monitor retries. After deploying the application, navigate to your siteâ€™s `/actuator` endpoint to see a list of Spring Boot Actuator endpoints. Navigate to `/actuator/retries` to see retried calls.

When the `CONTOSO_RETRY_DEMO` setting is set to 1, we not only simulate a failure for every web request to GitHub, but we also trigger the circuit-breaker mechanism. This mechanism prevents further attempts to call the API when it is failing, thus avoiding unnecessary load and potential cascading failures.

## Exercise - Retry and Circuit Break Pattern:

1. Set the `CONTOSO_RETRY_DEMO` setting to 1 in App Service Configuration.

2. Changing an application setting will cause the App Service to restart. Wait for the app to restart.

3. We added Spring Actuator Dependencies to the Proseware project. This enables actuator endpoints. Navigate to the following sites:
    * https://<FRONT_DOOR_URL>/actuator
    * https://<FRONT_DOOR_URL>/actuator/retryevents
    * https://<FRONT_DOOR_URL>/actuator/metrics/resilience4j.circuitbreaker.not.permitted.calls

4. Navigate to https://<FRONT_DOOR_URL>/index and refresh the page. Every time you refresh the page, a call to GitHub is made.
5. Navigate to https://<FRONT_DOOR_URL>/actuator/retryevents and make note of the retry events in the actuator endpoints.

To monitor the circuit-breaker, navigate to the https://<FRONT_DOOR_URL>/actuator/metrics/resilience4j.circuitbreaker.not.permitted.calls endpoint. This endpoint provides metrics about the number of calls that were not permitted due to the circuit breaker being open.

## Logs

Application logging is enabled. To view the logs, navigate to *Diagnose and solve problems*. From there, click on *Application Logs*.
